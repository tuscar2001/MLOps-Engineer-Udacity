# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project is aimed at conducting code best practices. This includes code refactoring, modularization, and testing according to auto-pep8 and pylint guidelines.

## Files and data description
Files are described as follows:
churn_distribution: Gives a distribution of the response variable as a bar chart
Customer_Age_distribution: gives a distribution of the customer Age
heatmap: gives a correlation matrix plot of the variables in the data
marital_status_distribution: gives a distribution of the marital status
feature_importance: give a feature importance of the features in the models
logistic_results: highlights the logistic regression model metrics
rf_results: highlights the random forest model metrics
roc_curve_plot: roc curve of both models
churn_library.log: log file of the churn_library file
logistic_model.pkl: logistic model pickle file
rfc_model.pkl: random forest model pickle file 

## Running Files
How do you run your files? What should happen when you run your files?
Running the churn_library.py: $python churn_library.py
Running the churn_script_logging_and_tests.py:$python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
Testing the churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: 1. Run autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
                                               2. Run pylint: pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
